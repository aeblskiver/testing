Clone or download the repo at https://github.com/aeblskiver/testing.git <br>
You'll only need the public and resources files from here <br>


dpd create whatever-directory-name <br>
cd whatever-directory-name <br>
npm install dpd-fileupload --save <br>

Replace the public and resources directories with the ones you got from my github <br>

dpd -d <br>
This takes you to the dashboard. <br>
Create a new resource (File Upload) and name it fileupload (This must be the same name as the form action in index.html) <br>
Click open on the top right to get to the webpage <br>
